### Project 1
- Retro Revival
- The Retro Revival website project involved developing a fully functional platform with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities, enabling user registration, login, report/request forms, and admin post management. The site features a game catalog and community page to connect retro gamers, with future plans to add a voting system and chat feature. Despite challenges like cPanel login issues and time constraints, the team prioritized core functionalities and collaborated effectively to deliver a user-friendly platform. The project received positive client feedback, with suggestions for improvements such as better organization and additional photos. Key outcomes include a responsive design, secure user authentication system, and a detailed business model canvas for future scalability, covering advertising, licensing, and website maintenance. This platform successfully fosters a community for retro gaming enthusiasts to share their passion for classic games.
