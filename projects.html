        <h3>Retro Revival </h3>
        <p><strong>About: </strong> Retro Revival is a community-driven web platform designed to unite retro gaming enthusiasts by offering a centralized hub for discovering, discussing, and engaging with classic games. 
          The project, developed by a team of four—Anthony Campbell, Michael Niemi, Matthew Herrera, and Jasmine Mendez—features a fully functional website with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities, including user registration, login, report and request forms, and admin post management. 
          Key outcomes include a home page showcasing top games, a game catalog, community features, and user feedback integration. Despite challenges like cPanel login issues and time constraints, the team prioritized core functionalities and gathered client feedback for future improvements, such as adding a voting system, chat feature, and enhanced visuals. 
          With a hypothetical $50k budget, funds would be allocated to maintenance, advertising, licensing, and legal insurance, aiming to expand the platform's reach and functionality.  </p>

        <h3>Clinical Data Warehouse</h3>
        <p><strong>About: </strong> This project was part of my Essential Programming for Health Informatics course. 
          I built a simple GUI using Python’s Tkinter library to make a clinical data warehouse more accessible to hospital staff who aren’t comfortable using the command line. 
          The program includes a secure login system with role-based access, so depending on the user’s role (nurse, clinician, admin, or management), they can do things like add or remove patient records, retrieve information, view clinical notes, count visits, or generate key statistics. 
          I followed clean coding practices, used GitHub for version control, and structured the project to be easy to maintain and expand in the future.   </p>
